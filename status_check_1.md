I have begun construction the Gyroscopic camera mount.
I still need to order my main board proccesor.
I still need to design a chasis for the car witch will be 3d printed out of PLA.
My output display will be a through the blynk app, my manual user input will be controlling the camer and the car, my automatic sensor will be the gyroscope on the camera to keep it stabalized, I am using 2 servos and 2 motors, there will be so much programming to this.
The biggest issue is coding the gyro and car systems.
